# twitter-friends

## Introduction

This chrome extension keeps track of the accounts on twitter as you
follow and unfollow them.  If you have the nagging suspicion that
an account has been unfollowed, but not by you, you'll be able
to verify.

This extension does not save any data to the cloud.  The list of
accounts you follow is saved in your browser itself.  No data in
your twitter account is ever altered.

Available in the chrome store: [twitter friends](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitter-friends/naijihjfccfofepjpfdbpoclacnnmepl?hl=en&gl=US)

### Acknowledgement

I used the code from [chrome-extension-template](https://github.com/edrpls/chrome-extension-template) as a starting point.
